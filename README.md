 The task is to create a simple contact list that should look like the below mockup. Use our API at
 https://candidate-test.herokuapp.com/contacts
# Requirements:
● Use AngularJS.
● Make sure the site is responsive
● Make sure more details come up when you hover on a user (see the mockup)
Things to consider:
● The search functionality is not required to work for this task.
● Feel free to use a CSS framework like Foundation or Bootstrap
● We prefer SASS. You can also use Less.
● Keep in mind the response times from the server will vary (0-8 seconds).
	We are looking for organized scalable frontend code that shows knowledgeable use of SASS and CSS.
	Show us your eye for detail and consideration for colleagues that will maintain and modify the code.
